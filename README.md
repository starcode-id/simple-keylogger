# simple-keylogger
A Rust-based keylogger application designed for ethical and educational purposes. This project logs keystrokes to a file and sends the logs to a Telegram bot. The application runs as a background daemon, making it efficient and non-intrusive. The project demonstrates the integration of asynchronous programming, system-level key event handling, and secure message delivery via the Telegram Bot API.
